**Password Manager**

Overview
The Password Manager is a simple yet powerful password management tool designed to help you securely store and manage your passwords. This application features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter module and utilizes JSON for data storage on the backend.

**Key Features:**
Password Generation: Automatically generates strong, random passwords for your accounts.
Search Functionality: Easily retrieve saved credentials for specific websites.
Local Data Storage: All data is stored locally on your machine in a JSON file. No data is stored on any server, ensuring privacy and security.
GUI-Based: While the app uses a GUI for ease of use, the underlying data storage is handled with JSON, making it lightweight and secure.

**How It Works:**
Add Password: Enter the website name, email/username, and password, and click Add to save the credentials.
Generate Password: Click Generate Password to create a secure, random password and automatically copy it to the clipboard.
Search Password: Use the Search button to look up credentials for a specific website.

**Privacy & Security:**
Local Storage: All password data is saved in a JSON file stored locally on your computer. The app does not communicate with any external servers, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.
No Data Collection: The app does not collect, track, or store any personal information beyond the data you input.
Encryption: Passwords are saved as plaintext within the local file; consider using an additional layer of encryption for even more security if needed.
Why JSON for Backend?
Even though the app has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), the backend is powered by JSON, which is a lightweight, human-readable format that makes data storage and retrieval simple and efficient. JSON allows easy access and portability of your password data, which you can back up or edit manually if needed. This also ensures the app remains fast and lightweight while providing a reliable way to store your sensitive data.

**Installation:**
To install and use the Password Manager:

Clone or download this repository.
**Install the required dependencies:**
* bash
* Copy code
* pip install pyperclip
* Run the app:
* bash
* Copy code
* python main.py
  
**Usage:**
Add Credentials:

Enter the website name in the "Website" field.
Enter your email/username for the account in the "Email/Username" field.
Enter your password in the "Password" field or generate one using the "Generate Password" button.
Click Add to save the credentials.

**Search for Credentials:**
Enter the website name in the "Website" field and click Search to retrieve the credentials.

**Generate Password:**
Click Generate Password to create a random, secure password for a new account or update an existing password.
Data Format:
All data is saved in a file called data.json in the same directory as the app. The structure of the file is as follows:

json
Copy code
{
    "website_name": {
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "password": "strongpassword123"
    }
}
This makes it easy for you to manually back up, edit, or transfer your password data if needed.

**Additional Notes:**
If you're concerned about the security of storing passwords in plain text, consider implementing an additional layer of encryption to store the passwords securely within the JSON file. This could be done using a library like cryptography.
The app uses JSON for backend storage due to its simplicity and ease of use. However, if you're looking for a more robust database solution, you can modify it to use SQLite or any other database technology.
